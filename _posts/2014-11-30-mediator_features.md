I have been self-learning math topics for a while, and I thought that I should be sharing/teaching what I learned. I first thought of this in 8th grade, but due to my lack of html skills at the time, I wasn't able to. But, I still came up with the layout, and the fundamental ideas. So, now, here it is. 

This is more of like a blog, as in, whenever I have done something math related that can't be easily found on the internet, I want to share it here. Given that this was made a long time after the beginning of my math journey, it is going to be lacking a lot of content.
