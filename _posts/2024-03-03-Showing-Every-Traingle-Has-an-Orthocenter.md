It is known that every triangle has an orthocenter, but do you know why? 

Take any of the 3 vertices of a triangle. Now draw a line from that vertex to the oposite side such that that line you just drew is perpendicular to that side. You just drew an altitude. Now, since a traingle has 3 vertices, it also has 3 altitudes. Would you believe me if I told you that these 3 lines (the altitudes) interesct at exactly one point? No? Well, I can prove it. All we have to do, is observe the angles that form when we draw these altitudes. 

#Explanation:
Let's start here. First draw and triangle and label its three vertices, say, A, B, and C. Next, draw 2 altitudes, say from A and B. Obviously these will intersect at a point, say point O. Now, draw a 3rd line from the vertex C (that doesn't yet have an altitude assosciated with it) to the point O. Extend this line to the opposite side, side AB. Let the point which OC intersects side AB be point D.

We wish to show that the angle formed by CDB (or CDA) is 90 degrees. Because if it is 90 degrees, that means it's perpendicular to side AB and that line also goes through vertex C, and so by definition, it will be an altitude. But more importantly, we would of shown that this third altitude also goes through point O.
