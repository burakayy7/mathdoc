It is known that every triangle has an orthocenter, but do you know why? 

Take any of the 3 vertices of a triangle. Now draw a line from that vertex to the oposite side such that that line you just drew is perpendicular to that side. You just drew an altitude. Now, since a traingle has 3 vertices, it also has 3 altitudes. Would you believe me if I told you that these 3 lines (the altitudes) interesct at exactly one point? No? Well, I can prove it. All we have to do, is observe the angles that form when we draw these altitudes.
